This tool operates with CAEN V1290 time to digital converters. The tool connects
to a number of V1290s, reads them out sequentially and stores the data in
`DataModel::tdc_readout` for further processing. Readout is performed by
continuous polling of the cards.

* `V1290::Initialise` connects to and configures the cards.
* `V1290::Execute` starts the readout thread.
* `V1290::Finalise` stops the readout thread and closes the connections.

The following settings configure the tool in general:

* `verbose`, integer: log verbosity level. The lower level, the more important
  the log message is.
* `standalone`, boolean: when 1, the tool does not require RunControl in the
  toolchain and can operate independently.

Each TDC setting in the configuration file can be specified either as
```
setting_name value
```
of as
```
setting_name_index value
```
for example,
```
enable_channels FFFF
enable_channels_1 0FFF
```
The first form, `setting_name` sets the default value for all of the cards. The
second form overrides the default value for card index (card 1 in the example).
Enumeration of the cards begins with 0.

The following settings describe how to connect to a V1290:

* `link`: connection link type, corresponds to the `LinkType` argument of
  `CAENComm_OpenDevice2` function of the
  [`CAENComm` library](https://www.caen.it/products/caencomm-library/).
  Allowed values:
  - `usb`: connection is via a USB link to a VME bridge.
  - `optical`: connection is via an optical link to a VME bridge.
  - `A4818-V2718`: connection is via a USB link to a A4818 Conet module which is
    connected by an optical link to a V2718 VME bridge.
  - `A4818-V3718`: connection is via a USB link to a A4818 Conet module which is
    connected by an optical link to a V3718 VME bridge.
  - `A4818-V4718`: connection is via a USB link to a A4818 Conet module which is
    connected by an optical link to a V4718 VME bridge.
  - `eth-V4718`: connection is via an Ethernet link to a V4718 VME bridge.
  - `usb-V4718`: connection is via a USB link to a V4718 VME bridge.
* `ip`: only used if `link` is `eth-V4718` --- IP address of the V4718.
* `arg` (0 by default):
  - in the case of a USB connection, the USB link number of the host. Unless
    there are multiple USB connections to CAEN devices, can be left as 0.
    Otherwise would require trial and error to determine.
  - in the case of an optical connection via V2718, V3718 or V4718, the optical
    link number.
  - in the case of a connection through A4818 or to the V4718, PID of the
    device, where PID is the product identification number and should be written
    on the device.
  - not used in the case of an Ethernet connection.
* `conet` (0 by default):
  - in the case of an optical link connection, it is the number of the device in
    the daisy chain of the optical link.
  - should be left as 0 for other kinds of connections.
* `vme`:
  - hexadecimal number representing 16 most significant bits of the VME base
    address of the device, e.g., `90AB`. This is the number set by the rotary
    switches on the board.

So, to connect to two V1290 cards with rotary switches set to 00AA and 10AA via
a V3718 VME bridge, you can write
```
link usb
vme_0 00AA
vme_1 10AA
```
